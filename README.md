# Overview

* This is my Java program which is called the "Favorite Food Tracker v1.0" which you can use add or remove your favorite foods from the ArrayList, or really any strings for that matter, and save it to a text file, and even read that file back into the list. So for example, if your list is "Burrito, Hotdog, Taco" and you save the list, then read it back, the ArrayList will then be "Burrito, Hotdog, Taco, Burrito, Hotdog, Taco."

* The purpose of completing this project was to learn Java and understand how it works and get better at using it to create simple projects just like this one.

* This program uses many Java functionalities such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, ArrayList, Scanner, FileWriter, FileReader, and BufferedReader.

# Video Demonstration

* This is a brief video that I recorded which shows how to use the program and how it works behind the scenes in terms of the code and structure.

# Development Environment

* The tool that I used to develop the software was Visual Studio Code. This is my favorite Integraded Development Environment because it is a very lightweight program yet it still includes a lot of advanced functionality.
* The programming language that I used to complete this project is Java JDK version 17. It is a very interesting and unique language which is based around object oriented programming and I enjoy using it very much.
* Github is the online repository I used to store this project.

# Useful Websites

These are some of the websites that were useful to me in making this project:
* [W3 Schools Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) - this is the tutorial which helped me learn how to write the code and the basic structures
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is what helped me solve weird problems and do something that wasn't explained in the tutorial
